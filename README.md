Barnapy
=======

Barnapy is a motley collection of Python born of the common code in my
research projects.  It is essentially infrastructure for data
processing.  I hope you find it interesting or useful.

This is more a public record of my work and a resource for others than a
project.  As such, I make no promises regarding API stability,
correctness, documentation, and the like.  I aim to continually improve
this software, and I will emphasize making this more like an "official"
set of modules as interest and use increases.

* Python >= 3.4 (which introduced re.fullmatch)
